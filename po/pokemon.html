				<h2>What is this shit?</h2>
				Pokémon (Japanese: ポケモン Hepburn: Pokemon, Japanese pronunciation: ['pokemoɴ]; English: /ˈpoʊkeɪˌmɒn/ POH-kay-MON or /ˈpoʊkᵻˌmɒn/ POH-ki-MON) is a media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a Japanese consortium between Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise copyright is shared by all three companies, but Nintendo is the sole owner of the trademark.[4] The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995,[5] and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon", which humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport.
